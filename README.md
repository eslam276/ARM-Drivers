# ARM Drivers for STM32F103C8T6 and STM32F446RE

# Overview

Welcome to the ARM Drivers repository! This Repo contains custom drivers developed for the STM32F103C8T6 and STM32F446RE microcontrollers, which are based on the Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 architectures, respectively. These drivers were designed and tested using the bluebill (STM32F103C8T6) and Nucleo Board (STM32F446RE) development boards.

# Modules
The repository is structured into the following modules:

* DMA: Direct Memory Access driver.
* EXTI: External Interrupt driver.
* GPIO: General Purpose Input/Output driver.
* NVIC: Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller driver.
* RCC: Reset and Clock Control driver.
* SCB: System Control Block driver.
* SYSCFG: System Configuration controller driver.
* USART: Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter driver.
